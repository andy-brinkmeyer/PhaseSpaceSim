 * \section  intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This library is part of a larger simulation pipeline. The library can be used to simulate a Linear Detector based motion
 * capture system like the PhaseSpace X2E. 
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * The library can be built using CMake. All dependencies are header-only libraries which are included in the source code. Optionally, some 
 * executables that test factor graph based estimation using camera and inertial measurements can also be built. Those depend on GTSAM which needs
 * to be installed seperately. Check out the GTSAM documentation for more information.
